This repository contains all the programs I developed as part of a crash course project focused on Python fundamentals. The project serves as a collection of foundational exercises from my Python programming course and is organized into four distinct sections:

Task 1: Datatypes - This section introduces the core data types in Python, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Each data type is accompanied by a program that demonstrates its use and functionality.

Task 2: Control Structures - This part covers the basics of control flow in Python, featuring if-else statements and while loops. The program determines if a user-input number is positive, negative, or zero.

Task 3: Calculator - This program is a simple calculator that prompts the user for two numbers and performs basic operations based on the userâ€™s selection.

Task 4: To-Do List App - The final section brings together most of the concepts covered throughout the course in a To-Do list application, applying skills learned in data types, control structures, and user input handling.
